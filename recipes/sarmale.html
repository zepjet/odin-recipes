<h2>You'll need minced meat,spices,salt,garlic,rice and fermented cabbage leaves</h2>
<ul>
     <li>minced meat of any kind but preferably pork or beef</li>
     <li>salt,spices,/li>
     <li>garlic</li>
     <li>rice</li>
     <li>fermented cabbage rolls</li>
     <h1>Steps</h1>
 <o1>
      <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high. Saute the onions until translucent, then add the rice and toast for 1 minute. Add the pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill, and the onion mixture to a large bowl and mix well. Use salt sparingly â€“ the cabbage leaves are brined.</li>
      <li>Remove the cabbage leaves from the brine. You can soak them in water beforehand to draw out some of the salt. Cut each leaf in half and fill the piece with a few tbsp of the meat mixture and roll. Refer to the video in the recipe card to see how I roll these nice and tight. Repeat until all the filling has been used.</li>
      <li>Chop up the remaining cabbage leaves and add them to a large pot or deep roasting dish with a lid. Arrange all the rolls over the chopped cabbage and disperse the bacon evenly among the rolls. Pour the tomato juice over the rolls and top up with some water, if needed, to ensure the rolls are covered with liquid.</li>
      <li>Remove the leaves and let them cool. Cut out the thickest part of each leaf at the bottom by slicing on each side of the rib to form a triangle.</li>
